# Face Mash 

A fun web app where two faces go head-to-head and users choose the winner. Each person has a dynamic rating that increases when they win matchups. Over time, the leaderboard ranks the highest-rated faces.

Built with a modern web stack and powered by Supabase for real-time data and storage.
